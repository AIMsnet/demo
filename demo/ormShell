1.Django shell
    Open up your local console (not on PythonAnywhere) and type this command:

    command-line:
    (myvenv)  C:\Users\aimcomp7\demo>  python manage.py shell

    The effect should be like this:

    command-line:
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>>

    You're now in Django's interactive console. It's just like the Python prompt. 
    You can use all the Python commands here too.

2. All objects
    Let's try to display all of our Author first. You can do that with the following command:

    >>> from ORM.models import Author

    We import the model Post from ORM.models. Let's try displaying all Author:

    command-line:
    >>> Author.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<Author: P.  L. Deshpande>, <Author: Chetan Bhagat>, <Author: Rabindranath Tagore>, <Author: Neel Mukharjee>, <Author: Ruskin Bond>]>

    This is a list of the posts we created earlier! We created these posts using the Django admin interface.

    command-line:
    >>> Book.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<Book: One Indian Girl>, <Book: The Secret>, <Book: Untouchable>, <Book: The Room On The Roof>, <Book: The White Tiger>]>


3. Filter objects
    >>> Book.objects.filter(author=2)
    <QuerySet [<Book: One Indian Girl>, <Book: The Secret>, <Book: The Room On The Roof>]



4 Close shell:
    Cool! You're now ready for the next part! To close the shell, type this:
     
    command-line:
    >>> exit()
